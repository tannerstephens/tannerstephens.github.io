# Hey!
Like the URL says, I'm Tanner and, if you hadn't figured out by now, I like coding! I'm not kidding, I actually think it's fun! This site is a collection of some of the things I have made over the past few years.

## Information
I am a software engineer of at least 3 years with experience in Python, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Java, and lots more! This site, while admittedly very awesome, is not a complete representation of all my projects, I've done a lot more! If you need to reach me, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:tanner@tannerstephens.com">tanner@tannerstephens.com</a>.
